**This is my recreation of Tetris**

I was inspired by a movie concerning the explosion of Tetris that I watched in my Computer Science class when I saw that the creator of Tetris did it in C I believe. 
Seeing that I thought I could do it without any major libraries and such.

This has been a great practice on planning a project and building things in the best way I highly reccomend

*Please excuse the terrible code, some of it was slapped together with duct tape.*
